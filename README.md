# Keymeleon
## Test Branch
This branch contains:
- `keymeleon-console`: a console version of the C++ keyboard control code that compiles as an `.exe` as opposed to the main branch's `.dll`, allowing easier testing of functions.
- `chameleon`: a C# WPF application calculates an average colour from image inputs, that does so using various techniques, and displays the outputs together, allowing easier testing and comparison of the methods used.

### Prerequisites
See each project subfolder's README for their respective prerequisites.
