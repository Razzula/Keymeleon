# chameleon
A C# WPF application calculates an average colour from image inputs, that does so using various techniques, and displays the outputs together, allowing easier testing and comparison of the methods used.

The purpose of this test project is to find the best method of calculating the average screen colour, so that that colour can be displayed on the keyboard when watching films/playing games, in a similar fashion to Philips' Ambilight technology.

### Prerequisites
`System.Drawing.Common` is required. It is available as a NuGet package.

### Notes
You will need to place some `.png` files in `images/` to use the application.
